### Homework - Optional

1. Run through the sample code in Droids on Roids, Part [1](https://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog/ios/rxswift-by-examples-1-the-basics/) & [2](https://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog/ios/rxswift-by-examples-2-observable-and-the-bind/). Both are good examples to run through. 
2. Also, read through the last [resource](https://github.com/orakaro/The-introduction-to-RxSwift-you-have-been-missing/blob/master/README.md) on the list. Its a pretty great intro into the subject.
